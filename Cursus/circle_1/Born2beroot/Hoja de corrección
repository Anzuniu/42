## Preliminary tests
· Defense can only happen if the student being evaluated or groups is present. This way everybody learns by sharing knowledge with each other.
· Uf no work has been submited (or wrong files, wrong directory, or wrong filenames), the grade is 0, and the evaluation process ends.
· For this project, you have to clone theus Git repository on their station.

## General instructions
· During the defense, as soon as you need help to verify a point, the student evaluated must help you.
· Ensure that the "signature.txt" file is present at the root of the cloned repository.
· Check that the signature contained in "signature.txt" is identical to that of the ".vdi" file of the virtual machine to be evaluated. A simple "diff" should allow you to compare the two signatures. If necessary, ask the student being evaluated where theris ".vdi" file is located.
· As a precaution, you can duplicate the initial virtual machine in order to keep a copy.
· Start the virtual machine to be evaluated.
· If something doesn't work as expected or the two signatures differ, the evaluation stops here.

## Mandatory part
# Project overview
· The student being evaluated should explain to you simply:
  - How a virtual machine works.
  - Their choice of operating system.
  - The basic differences between Rocky and Debian.
  - The purpose of virtual machine.
  - If the evaluated student chose Rocky: what SELinux and DNF are.
  - If the evaluated student chose Debian: the difference between aptitude and apt, and what APPPArmir is. During the defense, a script must display information all every 10 minutes. Its operation will be checked in detail later. If the explanations are not clear, the evaluation stops here.
