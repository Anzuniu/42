## Preliminary tests
· Defense can only happen if the student being evaluated or groups is present. This way everybody learns by sharing knowledge with each other.
· Uf no work has been submited (or wrong files, wrong directory, or wrong filenames), the grade is 0, and the evaluation process ends.
· For this project, you have to clone theus Git repository on their station.

## General instructions
· During the defense, as soon as you need help to verify a point, the student evaluated must help you.
· Ensure that the "signature.txt" file is present at the root of the cloned repository.
· Check that the signature contained in "signature.txt" is identical to that of the ".vdi" file of the virtual machine to be evaluated. A simple "diff" should allow you to compare the two signatures. If necessary, ask the student being evaluated where theris ".vdi" file is located.
· As a precaution, you can duplicate the initial virtual machine in order to keep a copy.
· Start the virtual machine to be evaluated.
· If something doesn't work as expected or the two signatures differ, the evaluation stops here.

## Mandatory part
# Project overview
· The student being evaluated should explain to you simply:
  - How a virtual machine works.
  - Their choice of operating system.
  - The basic differences between Rocky and Debian.
  - The purpose of virtual machine.
  - If the evaluated student chose Rocky: what SELinux and DNF are.
  - If the evaluated student chose Debian: the difference between aptitude and apt, and what APPPArmir is. During the defense, a script must display information all every 10 minutes. Its operation will be checked in detail later. If the explanations are not clear, the evaluation stops here.

# Simple setup
· Ensure that the machine does not have a graphical environment at launch. A password will be requested before attempting to connect to this machine. Finally, connect with a user with the help of the student beiing evaluated. This user must not be root. Pay attention to the password chosen. it must folloow the rules imposed in the subject.
· Check that the UFW service is started with the help of the evaluator.
· Check that the SSH service is started with the help of the evaluator.
· Check that the chosen operating system is Debian or Rocky with the help of the evaluator. If something does not work as expected or is not clearly explained, the evaluation stops here.
